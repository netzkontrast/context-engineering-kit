# MCP Plugin

Commands for integrating Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers with your AI-powered development workflow. Set up well-known MCP servers and create custom servers to extend LLM capabilities.

## Plugin Target

Simplify integration of MCP servers into your development workflow.

## Overview

The MCP (Model Context Protocol) plugin helps you integrate MCP servers into your development environment. MCP is an open protocol that enables AI assistants to interact with external services, databases, and tools through a standardized interface.

This plugin provides three key commands:

1. **Context7 MCP Setup** - Access up-to-date documentation for any library or framework
2. **Serena MCP Setup** - Enable semantic code analysis and symbol-based operations
3. **Build MCP** - Create custom MCP servers for any service or API

Each command guide through the MCP setup processes and updates your project's CLAUDE.md file to ensure consistent MCP usage across your team.

## Quick Start

Open Claude Code in your project directory and run the following commands to setup MCP servers.

```bash
# Install the plugin
/plugin install mcp@NeoLabHQ/context-engineering-kit

# Set up documentation access for your project
> /mcp:setup-context7-mcp react, typescript, prisma

# Enable semantic code analysis
> /mcp:setup-serena-mcp
```

[Usage Examples](./usage-examples.md)

## Commands Overview

### /mcp:setup-context7-mcp - Documentation Access

Set up Context7 MCP server to provide real-time access to library and framework documentation, eliminating hallucinations from outdated training data.

- Purpose - Configure documentation access for your project's technology stack
- Output - Working Context7 integration with CLAUDE.md configuration

```bash
/mcp:setup-context7-mcp [technologies]
```

#### What is Context7?

Context7 is an MCP server that fetches up-to-date documentation with code examples for any library or framework. Instead of relying on potentially outdated training data, the LLM can query actual documentation in real-time.

Benefits:
- Access latest API references and code examples
- Eliminate hallucinations about deprecated methods or incorrect signatures
- Get version-specific documentation for your exact dependencies
- Reduce back-and-forth when the LLM suggests outdated patterns

#### Arguments

Optional list of languages and frameworks to configure documentation for. If omitted, the command analyzes your project structure to identify relevant technologies.

Examples:
- `react, typescript, prisma` - Specific technologies
- `nextjs 14, tailwind` - Version-specific documentation
- (no arguments) - Auto-detect from project files

#### How It Works

1. **Availability Check**: Verifies if Context7 MCP server is already configured
2. **Setup Guidance**: If not available, guides you through the installation process for your operating system and development environment
3. **Technology Analysis**: Parses your input or scans project structure to identify relevant documentation
4. **Documentation Search**: Queries Context7 to find available documentation IDs for your technologies
5. **CLAUDE.md Update**: Adds recommended library IDs and usage instructions to your project configuration

#### Usage Examples

```bash
# Configure for a React/TypeScript project
> /mcp:setup-context7-mcp react, typescript, @tanstack/react-query

# Let the command detect technologies from your project
> /mcp:setup-context7-mcp

# Specific framework versions
> /mcp:setup-context7-mcp nextjs 14, prisma 5, zod
```

After setup, your CLAUDE.md will include:

```markdown
### Use Context7 MCP for Loading Documentation

Context7 MCP is available to fetch up-to-date documentation with code examples.

**Recommended library IDs**:

- `react` - React core library documentation
- `typescript` - TypeScript language reference
- `prisma` - Prisma ORM documentation
```

#### Best Practices

- Run early in project setup to establish documentation access from the start
- Include specific versions when working with rapidly evolving libraries
- Review the generated documentation IDs and remove any that are not relevant
- Re-run when adding new major dependencies to your project

### /mcp:setup-serena-mcp - Semantic Code Analysis

Set up Serena MCP server for semantic code retrieval and symbol-based editing capabilities, enabling precise code manipulation in large codebases.

- Purpose - Enable intelligent code navigation and manipulation
- Output - Configured Serena integration with indexed project

```bash
/mcp:setup-serena-mcp [configuration preferences]
```

#### What is Serena?

Serena is an MCP server that provides semantic understanding of your codebase. Unlike text-based search (grep), Serena understands code structure - functions, classes, types, and their relationships.

Benefits:
- Find symbols by meaning, not just text matching
- Navigate complex codebases with symbol-based operations
- Make precise code changes without breaking references
- Understand code relationships and dependencies
- Refactor with confidence using semantic operations

#### Arguments

Optional configuration preferences or client type. The command adapts its setup guidance based on your development environment (Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cursor, VSCode, etc.).

#### How It Works

1. **Availability Check**: Tests if Serena tools (`find_symbol`, `list_symbols`) are accessible
2. **Documentation Loading**: Fetches latest Serena documentation for setup guidance
3. **Prerequisites Verification**: Confirms `uv` is installed (required for running Serena)
4. **Client Configuration**: Provides setup instructions specific to your MCP client
5. **Project Setup**: Guides through project initialization and indexing
6. **Connection Test**: Verifies Serena tools are working correctly
7. **CLAUDE.md Update**: Adds semantic code analysis guidelines to your project

#### Usage Examples

```bash
# Standard setup with auto-detection
> /mcp:setup-serena-mcp

# Specify your client
> /mcp:setup-serena-mcp cursor

# With specific configuration needs
> /mcp:setup-serena-mcp claude-desktop
```

After setup, your CLAUDE.md will include:

```markdown
### Use Serena MCP for Semantic Code Analysis

Serena MCP is available for advanced code retrieval and editing capabilities.

- Use Serena's tools for precise code manipulation in structured codebases
- Prefer symbol-based operations over file-based grep/sed operations

Key usage points:
- Use `find_symbol` to locate functions, classes, and types by name
- Use `list_symbols` to explore available symbols in a file or module
- Prefer semantic operations for refactoring over text replacement
```

#### Best Practices

- Set up Serena for large codebases where text search becomes unwieldy
- Use semantic operations for refactoring to ensure all references are updated
- Re-index the project after major structural changes
- Combine with Context7 for documentation + code understanding
- Prefer symbol-based navigation over grep for code exploration

### /mcp:build-mcp - Custom MCP Server Development

Comprehensive guide for creating high-quality MCP servers that enable LLMs to interact with external services through well-designed tools.

- Purpose - Build custom MCP servers for any service or API
- Output - Production-ready MCP server with tools and evaluations

```bash
/mcp:build-mcp
```

#### When to Build Custom MCP Servers

Build an MCP server when you need the LLM to:
- Interact with internal company APIs or services
- Access databases or data sources not available via existing MCP servers
- Integrate with third-party services (CRMs, project management, communication tools)
- Perform specialized operations unique to your domain

#### How It Works

The command guides you through a four-phase development process:

**Phase 1: Deep Research and Planning**

1. **Agent-Centric Design Principles**
   - Build workflow tools, not just API wrappers
   - Optimize for limited context windows
   - Design actionable error messages
   - Follow natural task subdivisions

2. **Protocol Study**: Load MCP specification from `modelcontextprotocol.io`

3. **Framework Selection**:
   - Python with FastMCP for rapid development
   - TypeScript with MCP SDK for type safety

4. **API Research**: Exhaustively study the target API documentation

5. **Implementation Planning**:
   - Tool selection and prioritization
   - Shared utilities design
   - Input/output schema design
   - Error handling strategy

**Phase 2: Implementation**

1. **Project Structure**: Set up according to language-specific best practices
2. **Core Infrastructure**: Build shared utilities first (API helpers, error handling, formatting)
3. **Tool Implementation**: Systematically implement each planned tool
4. **Annotations**: Add proper tool hints (readOnly, destructive, idempotent)

**Phase 3: Review and Refine**

1. **Code Quality Review**: DRY principle, composability, consistency
2. **Testing**: Verify syntax and imports (note: MCP servers are long-running, use evaluation harness)
3. **Quality Checklist**: Language-specific verification

**Phase 4: Create Evaluations**

1. **Tool Inspection**: Understand available capabilities
2. **Content Exploration**: Use read-only operations to explore data
3. **Question Generation**: Create 10 complex, realistic evaluation questions
4. **Answer Verification**: Verify each answer is correct and stable

#### Usage Examples

```bash
# Start building an MCP server
> /mcp:build-mcp

# The command will guide you through:
# 1. Understanding your integration requirements
# 2. Choosing Python or TypeScript
# 3. Designing tools for your use case
# 4. Implementing with best practices
# 5. Testing and evaluation
```
