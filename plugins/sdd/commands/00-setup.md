## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Outline

You are updating the project constitution at `specs/constitution.md`, create folder and file if not exists. Use file template at the bottom, it is containing placeholder tokens in square brackets (e.g. `[PROJECT_NAME]`, `[PRINCIPLE_1_NAME]`). Your job is to (a) collect/derive concrete values, (b) fill the template precisely, and (c) propagate any amendments across dependent artifacts.

Follow this execution flow:

1. **Greeting & Intent**:
   - Briefly acknowledge the user's request (e.g., "I'll help you set up the project constitution...").
   - If the user input implies specific principles (e.g., "Use strict TDD"), confirm you will incorporate them.

2. Write the existing constitution template to `specs/constitution.md` file.
   - Identify every placeholder token of the form `[ALL_CAPS_IDENTIFIER]`.
   **IMPORTANT**: The user might require less or more principles than the ones used in the template. If a number is specified, respect that - follow the general template. You will update the doc accordingly.

3. Collect/derive values for placeholders:
   - If user input (conversation) supplies a value, use it.
   - Otherwise infer from existing repo context (README, docs, CLAUDE.md,prior constitution versions if embedded).
   - For governance dates: `RATIFICATION_DATE` is the original adoption date (if unknown ask or mark TODO), `LAST_AMENDED_DATE` is today if changes are made, otherwise keep previous.
   - `CONSTITUTION_VERSION` must increment according to semantic versioning rules:
     - MAJOR: Backward incompatible governance/principle removals or redefinitions.
     - MINOR: New principle/section added or materially expanded guidance.
     - PATCH: Clarifications, wording, typo fixes, non-semantic refinements.
   - If version bump type ambiguous, propose reasoning before finalizing.

4. Draft the updated constitution content:
   - Replace every placeholder with concrete text (no bracketed tokens left except intentionally retained template slots that the project has chosen not to define yet—explicitly justify any left).
   - Preserve heading hierarchy and comments can be removed once replaced unless they still add clarifying guidance.
   - Ensure each Principle section: succinct name line, paragraph (or bullet list) capturing non‑negotiable rules, explicit rationale if not obvious.
   - Ensure Governance section lists amendment procedure, versioning policy, and compliance review expectations.

5. Consistency propagation checklist (convert prior checklist into active validations):
   - Write `specs/templates/plan-template.md` if it not exists and ensure any "Constitution Check" or rules align with updated principles.
   - Write `specs/templates/spec-template.md` if it not exists and ensure scope/requirements alignment—update if constitution adds/removes mandatory sections or constraints.
   - Write `specs/templates/tasks-template.md` if it not exists and ensure task categorization reflects new or removed principle-driven task types (e.g., observability, versioning, testing discipline).
   - Read any runtime guidance docs (e.g., `README.md`, `docs/quickstart.md`, or agent-specific guidance files if present). Update references to principles changed.

6. Produce a Sync Impact Report (prepend as an HTML comment at top of the constitution file after update):
   - Version change: old → new
   - List of modified principles (old title → new title if renamed)
   - Added sections
   - Removed sections
   - Templates requiring updates (✅ updated / ⚠ pending) with file paths
   - Follow-up TODOs if any placeholders intentionally deferred.

7. Validation before final output:
   - No remaining unexplained bracket tokens.
   - Version line matches report.
   - Dates ISO format YYYY-MM-DD.
   - Principles are declarative, testable, and free of vague language ("should" → replace with MUST/SHOULD rationale where appropriate).

8. Write the completed constitution back to `specs/constitution.md` (overwrite).

9. Output a **Final Summary** to the user with the following structure:
   - 🎉 **Success**: A friendly message confirming the constitution is ready.
   - 📝 **Version**: The new version (e.g., `v1.0.0`) and bump rationale.
   - 📂 **Files Created/Updated**: A list of files modified.
   - ⚠️ **Action Items**: Any manual follow-ups needed (e.g., filling in TODOs).
   - 💡 **Next Steps**: Suggest running `/sdd:01-specify` to start a new feature.
   - 💻 **Commit Suggestion**: `docs: amend constitution to vX.Y.Z (principle additions + governance update)`

Formatting & Style Requirements:

- Use Markdown headings exactly as in the template (do not demote/promote levels).
- Wrap long rationale lines to keep readability (<100 chars ideally) but do not hard enforce with awkward breaks.
- Keep a single blank line between sections.
- Avoid trailing whitespace.

If the user supplies partial updates (e.g., only one principle revision), still perform validation and version decision steps.

If critical info missing (e.g., ratification date truly unknown), insert `TODO(<FIELD_NAME>): explanation` and include in the Sync Impact Report under deferred items.

Do not create a new template; always operate on the existing `specs/constitution.md` file.
